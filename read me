readme file provided by "Kosar Khajeh" in order to introduce magnetic field force into NAMD source code version 12.


It should be mentioned that, only "ComputeMField.C" and "ComputeMfield.h" are new files in this category. As you know, both the electric field and magnetic field are electomagnetic wave 
and fundamentally are the same. In this implementation we have tried ro follw the method which has used to apply electric field inside the source code.
 These files contain the neccessary relation for description of magnetic field based on the Lorentz force and these files have been connected to the other files in the source code.
 for more information about other files please see the NAMD.pdf and below link;
