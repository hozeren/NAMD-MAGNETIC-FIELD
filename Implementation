Please follow below items;

1-Download NAMD source code version 12 (Version 2.12 (2016-12-22) Platforms) from below link;
https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=NAMD

2-Try to to compile NAMD based on the mentioned procedure in the website of NAMD.
To be sure your compiling has done correctly, you can use below files to test your running; 
"ion.conf, ion.pdb, ion.psf, ion.par"
compile NAMD by using below comment;
"./namd2 ion.conf | tee ion1.log"

now, you are ready to implement the source code.

3-In this step you should copy and replecs several files in the main source (src) folder;
copy below files in "NAMD_2.12_Source/src";
"SimParameters.h, SimParameters.c, ComputeMField.h, ComputeMField.c NamdTypes.h, homepatch.c, WorkDistrib.h, WorkDistrib.c, ComputeMap.h, ComputeMap.c,ComputeMao.h, ComputeMgr.h, ComputeMgr.c"
 and then copy below files in "NAMD_2.12_Source";
"Make.charm, Make.depends, Makefile"

It should be mentioned that, only "ComputeMField.C" and "ComputeMfield.h" are new files in this category. As you know, both the electric field and magnetic field are electomagnetic wave 
and fundamentally are the same. In this implementation we have tried ro follw the method which has used to apply electric field inside the source code.
 These files contain the neccessary relation for description of magnetic field based on the Lorentz force and these files have been connected to the other files in the source code.
 for more information about other files please see the NAMD.pdf and below link;
 http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/development.html
We edited other mentioned files to connect these files together.

4-cd Linux-x86_64-g++
  make
 (before "make", please open the "ComputeMField.C" file and change the provider name to yours, then save the file and comment "make")
 
5-finished 
 you can add below comment to "configuration file" to active magnetic field
 ### magnetic field
mFieldOn                        on
mField                          Bx By Bz

(B is internal unit of NAMD)

pleas remind that;
1[T]=0.023e-5[internal unit NAMD]
